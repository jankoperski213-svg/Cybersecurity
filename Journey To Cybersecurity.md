# Journey To Cybersecurity
## Documenting My First Steps into Cybersecurity

### About Me
I am an aspiring **Cybersecurity professional** following a structured **12-month learning roadmap**.  
My focus is on **hands-on skills**, continuous learning, and practical projects.  
I am motivated by curiosity about how systems work and a drive to help secure digital environments.  

**Goal:** Land my first Cybersecurity role within a year.

---

### First Month of Learning
I began with **Introduction to Cybersecurity (Cisco Networking Academy)**.  
Notes are available in the branch: `Foundations`.

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Definition of Cybersecurity**  
  Cybersecurity is not only about firewalls and antivirus software, but about **protecting data, systems, and people**.  
  It covers **prevention, detection, and response**.  
  Biggest realization: **cybersecurity is about trust**—ensuring users, organizations, and systems can rely on technology.

- **Common Threats**  
  Learned about **malware, phishing, ransomware**, and social engineering.  
  Most striking: **simple phishing campaigns can be more effective than sophisticated technical exploits**.  
  The human factor is often the weakest link.

- **Basic Security Principles (CIA Triad)**  
  **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability** are the foundation of all security decisions.  
  Example: patching too quickly may hurt availability, delaying patches may hurt confidentiality and integrity.  
  **Security is always a balance.**

- **Network Fundamentals**  
  Learned how data moves between devices, which protocols are involved, and how traffic can be analyzed.  
  Network visibility and monitoring are **critical for detecting attacks early**.

- **Career Insights**  
  Explored roles from **SOC Analyst** to **Penetration Tester**.  
  Both defense (Blue Team) and offense (Red Team) are valuable.  
  My path may combine both, motivating me to follow a structured **3-year roadmap**.

### Long-Term Roadmap  
Following the **Team Purple Path**:

- **Year 1 – Blue Foundation:** Linux, Networking, Cybersecurity basics, Security+ prep  
- **Year 2 – Blue → Purple Transition:** SOC skills, SIEM tools, scripting, first SOC role  
- **Year 3 – Purple Specialization:** Threat hunting, incident response, red/purple team labs

---

### Skills in Progress
- Linux basics (`NDG Linux 1`)  
- Networking fundamentals (Cisco)  
- Git & GitHub workflow  
- Cybersecurity foundations  

---

### Next Steps
- Continue **NDG Linux 1**  
- Start **Google Cybersecurity course (Coursera)**  
- Document projects & labs in **dedicated repositories**  
- Prepare for **CompTIA Security+**
